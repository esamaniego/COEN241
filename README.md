Simplified gfs(google file system)

User can upload, download, list, delete files. The files are broken down into chunks and are replicated in different disks. The file should always be avaialable to the user. Down drives or corrupted files should not be a problem since the files were replicated. Drives can be added or removed and so the system should be able to handle the balancing of file distribution and the correct file replication.
